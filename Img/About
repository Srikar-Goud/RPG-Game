In the war-scarred kingdom of Valdaren, dragons once ruled the skies, feared and worshipped as gods. That age of terror ended with the rise of the Dragon Repellers, a legendary order of warriors sworn to seal the beasts beneath the mountains.

But peace is never eternal.

Centuries later, the seals are breaking. Villages burn. Sky turns red. And a lone survivor from a ruined village—you—must uncover your hidden lineage, wield ancient weapons, and reclaim the lost arts of the Repellers.

Form your party, choose your path, and fight your fate.
